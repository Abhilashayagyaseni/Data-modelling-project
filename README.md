# Data-modelling-project


Created a "Data Modeling project" for visualizing and extracting insights from several different sets of related data to show total sales per region.
I have tried it using both 'Power BI' & 'Excel'
some key points are
- Integrate data from multiple table
- Connect them by defining relationship
- Extract insights
