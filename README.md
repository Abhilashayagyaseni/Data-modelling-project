# Data-modelling-project


Created a "Data Modeling project" for visualizing and extracting insights from several different sets of related data to show total sales per region.
I have tried it using both 'Power BI' & 'Excel'

- Here connecting total 4 tables to get insights
  - region data
  - product data
  - fact sales
  - customer data
- Integrate data from these tables
- Connect them by defining relationship (common column)
- Extract insights from new table and use data for visualization
